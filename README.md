# Computing-and-Information-Systems-work

Various papers written on topics such as Operating Systems, Systems and Analysis, Database management, Intro to Computer Science, System and comp apps, As well as intro java, and some network programming

The files are unordered and many could not be added due to original files being lost when switching computers between terms.
